## Project Architecture

**Free Water Tips** is a full-stack web application with a serverless backend:

### Frontend
- **Web**: Vanilla JavaScript SPA with [Google Maps](https://developers.google.com/maps) integration
- **Mobile**: [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) with WebView (planned)
- **Hosting**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) (static hosting)

### Backend  
- **API**: [Azure Functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/) (C#) with HTTP triggers
- **Database**: [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/cosmos-db) with JSON documents
- **Deployment**: Azure serverless architecture

### Development Stack
- **Languages**: JavaScript, C#
- **Frameworks**: Vanilla JS, [Azure Functions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)
- **Database**: [Azure Cosmos DB](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) (local emulator for development)
- **CI/CD**: [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)
- **Tools**: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Azure Functions Core Tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local)


## Development Setup

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

**üöÄ Use our automated setup script - this is the officially supported way to set up your development environment:**

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/free-water-tips.git
cd free-water-tips

# Run the setup script (checks prerequisites and sets up everything)
npm run setup # or './scripts/setup-dev.sh' directly if Node.js is not already installed
```

The setup script will:
- ‚úÖ Check all prerequisites and guide you through installation if needed
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies
- ‚úÖ Create configuration files from templates
- ‚úÖ Set up development environment for all layers
- ‚úÖ Provide next steps and available commands

### Manual Setup (Alternative)

If you prefer not to use the setup script, here are the manual steps:

**Prerequisites:**
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (latest LTS)
- [Azure Functions Core Tools v4](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local#install-the-azure-functions-core-tools)
- [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator) (Windows) or [Docker version](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/linux-emulator) (Linux/macOS)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

**Steps:**
1. Install dependencies: `npm install` (root), `npm install` (src/db), `dotnet restore` (src/api)
2. Copy configuration templates:
   - [`src/web/js/config/config.example.json`](src/web/js/config/config.example.json) ‚Üí `config.json`
   - [`src/api/local.settings.example.json`](src/api/local.settings.example.json) ‚Üí `local.settings.json`
   - [`src/db/.env.example`](src/db/.env.example) ‚Üí `.env`
3. Add your API keys ([Google Maps API key](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials) required)
4. Start [Azure Cosmos DB Emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cosmos-db/local-emulator)
5. Run database seeding: `npm run db:seed:locations`

**üí° Tip: The setup script handles all edge cases and platform differences. Manual setup may require troubleshooting.**

### Development Commands

```bash
# Start full-stack development (recommended)
npm run all:start

# Individual components
npm run web:start         # Web app (http://localhost:3000)
npm run api:start         # API server (http://localhost:7071)
npm run db:seed:locations # Populate database with sample data

# Database management
npm run db:clean          # Clear all data
npm run db:reset          # Clean and reseed
```

### Configuration

Configuration files follow a consistent `.example` ‚Üí runtime pattern:
- [`config.example.json`](src/web/js/config/config.example.json) ‚Üí `config.json` (web)
- [`local.settings.example.json`](src/api/local.settings.example.json) ‚Üí `local.settings.json` (API)  
- [`.env.example`](src/db/.env.example) ‚Üí `.env` (database)

See [Configuration Guide](docs/configuration-guide.md) for details.
