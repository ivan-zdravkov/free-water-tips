For a faster setup process, you can use our automated setup script:

```bash
npm run setup
```

This script will:
- Install all dependencies (Node.js packages and .NET packages)
- Create configuration files from templates (config.json for /web and local.settings.json for api)
- Set up both web and .NET API development environments
- Check prerequisites (.NET SDK, Azure Functions Core Tools, Node.js)
- Guide you through API key setup

#### Application Start

```bash
# Start both web and API servers
npm run all:start
```

**Individual Components:**
