# Free Water Tips

**Water is a right, not a product.**

This repository is dedicated to promoting access to **free drinking water** for everyone, everywhere.

The UN believes that water is a [fundamental human right](https://www.unwater.org/water-facts/human-rights-water-and-sanitation) and should not be treated as a commodity.

Our mission is to make it easier for people to find **places that serve safe drinking water** not burdened by a product or service tax.

## About the Project

The [Free Water Tips](/README.md) project consists of a [Web App](freewater.tips), an [Android App](), and an [iOS App]() all of which offer user-friendly ways of finding where free and safe drinking water is served.

More about how the project came to be you can find in the [Personal Statement](./docs/personal-statement.md) of the creator [Ivan Zdravkov](https://zdravkov.dev).

## Why This Matters

Access to clean drinking water is a basic human necessity. However, in many places, people are forced to buy bottled water, contributing to unnecessary expenses and environmental waste, even though perfectly safe and free alternatives exist. By connecting users with restaurants, cafes, and other establishments that offer free drinking water, we aim to:

- Promote sustainability by reducing plastic waste.
- Encourage businesses to support the community by offering free water.
- Raise awareness about the importance of water as a shared resource.
- Discourage the unfair monetization of water.

## Features

- **Proximity-Based Search**: Find the nearest locations offering free drinking water using a maps integration.
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Access the service via the web, Android, or iOS.
- **Free and Anonymous Usage**: Use free without ever logging in.
- **Community Contributions**: Add locations to help others.

## How You Can Help

- **Spread the Word**: Share the project with your friends, family, and community.
- **Add Locations**: If you know of places that serve free drinking water, add them to our database.
- **Contribute**: Help us improve the project by contributing code, reporting issues, or suggesting features. Find out how in the [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md).

## Monetization

### Free Forever

The website and applications are and forever will be open-source and free to use. In the spirit of making water more freely available, I believe accessing where to find it should be equally as free. I won't ever introduce payments, subscriptions, ads or fees to get rid of ads, nor will I sell businesses highlights or search placements. Your data also won't be collected and sold to third parties.

### Donations

Even though the applications are free, the infrastructure and developer fees cost a bit, so if you do enjoy my mission and want to contribute to it, donations are welcome!

## Development Environment Setup

Before you start development, make sure your environment has all the required dependencies installed.

Run the health check script to verify your setup:

```bash
./health.sh
```

This script will check for:
- Core development tools (Git, Node.js v22+, .NET SDK v10+)
- Azure Functions Core Tools
- Cosmos DB Emulator (via Docker)
- Expo & React Native dependencies
- Platform-specific tools (Android SDK, Xcode for iOS on macOS)
- Project dependencies

The script provides clear installation instructions for any missing dependencies based on your operating system.
