## Why I’m Building Free Water Tips

After being laid off from VMware, I decided to use my downtime to grow both personally and professionally. I wanted to solve a real-world problem that resonates with me while refreshing my skills and showcasing my abilities. The heavy and unfair monetization of drinking water is a topic I deeply care about, and I saw an opportunity to turn this concern into a meaningful application.

This project is not just about building an app, it’s about challenging myself, learning new technologies, and emphasizing what I already know well. It’s a chance to flex my artistic muscles and quickly build an end-to-end web and mobile application that makes a difference.

I've mostly worked within bigger teams and contributed to large enterprise systems. What I'm lacking in skills is quickly and cheaply delivering an idea to production which could be a knowledge gap fillment to allow for an effective startup launch down the line.

## What I Want to Achieve

1. **Solve a Real Problem**: Create a meaningful platform that connects people with free drinking water locations, reducing plastic waste and promoting sustainability.
2. **Learn and Grow**:
   - Deepen my knowledge of [Serverless Architecture](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/solutions/serverless) and **NoSQL** databases with [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) and [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) down the line.
   - Refresh my skills in [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/), [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and **modern CI/CD pipelines**.
   - Go back in time to writing a web application framework-free with latest JavaScript goodies and learning [.NET MAUI](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/apps/maui) for cross-platform applications.
3. **Showcase My Expertise**:
   - Leverage my experience in **Full Stack Software Engineering**, **Application and Cloud Architectures**, and **Databases**.
   - Highlight my ability to design scalable, containerized microservices with **Infrastructure as Code**.

## Why This Approach?
I want to build the simplest, most scalable solution that aligns with modern development practices. By using Azure, Serverless Functions and Infrastructure as Code, I can ensure the project is cost-effective, scalable, and easy to maintain. The feature-branch approach allows for rapid iteration and testing, which is crucial for an open-source project like this.

## How I’m Using AI to Accelerate Development

AI has become an invaluable tool in helping me move quickly and efficiently while building this project. I’m using AI in three main ways:

1. **Bouncing Ideas**:  
   I use AI as a brainstorming partner to verbalize my thoughts and get feedback. I provide light preferences to guide the conversation in the direction I want, iterating conversationally until I’m happy with a solution worth exploring deeply. This saves me significant research time and helps me focus on what’s worth investigating further.

2. **Documentation Assistance**:  
   AI helps me draft and refine user and technical documentation and even this personal statement. When it has access to the context of what’s being documented, it becomes an efficient tool for creating clear and concise explanations.

3. **Quick Problem Solving**:  
   I use AI for quick references, error explanations, simple function implementations and trivial problems that have been solved reliably and consistently for ages. For example:
   - Filter properties out of a JSON.
   - Generating a regex to filter out invalid emails.
   - Creating a random password generator with specific constraints.
   - Populating error messages or simplifying repetitive tasks like switch statements.  

## How I am NOT using AI
Everything AI generated gets reviewed, tested and ultimately owned by me. AI is a tool in my tool box, not the whole darn toolbox. I am ultimately not letting AI:
- Make design or architectural decisions for me.
- Generation complex functions, full classes, modules or whole applications.
- Make critical security decisions.
- Handle sensitive data.
- Vibe code... yikes.
